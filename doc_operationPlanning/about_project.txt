This project has a welcome interface in both English and Spanish.

The user is asked to select the language from the two buttons in the upper part of the window 
("Bienvenido!" - for using Spanish language for the rest of the sesion or "Welcome!" - for using English 
for the rest of the session). 

After the credentials are checked this window will not be visible anymore 
and the one coresponding with the language previously selected will be now visible. The user is not 
allowed to change the language during the sesion. To do so, it has to close the sesion and reopen another 
one.
