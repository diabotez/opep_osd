# Introduction

This project focuses on the software GUI of the Orthopedic Department. This department has more operating 
rooms available for non-urgent orthopedic surgeries. Each operating room is fully scheduled to one team per day.

This project will be used by medics from the Orthopedic Department to improve the ocupancy rate of the 
operating rooms without being neccessar to do overtime. The targeted ocuancy rate in this project is 80%. 
The remaining 20% is used for cleaning and also to cover the possibility that a surgery takes longer than 
planed.

     * create and modify schedules for the available operating rooms
